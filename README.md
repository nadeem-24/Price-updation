# Price-updation

Project Details - We have an excel sheet 'produceSales.xlsx' it contains four columns Produce,Cost per pound, Pounds sold and Total respectively. 

We have to update the cost per pound of the following Produce 
and correct the total for that row and in addition to that we have to highlight the total who are over 100.

The produces whose cost per pound needs to be updated in the sheet.
Celery = 1.19
Garlic = 3.07
Lemon = 1.27

The final updated excel sheet 'Update Produce Sales.xlsx'must contain the above values for those specific produce cells and a correct total for that.
